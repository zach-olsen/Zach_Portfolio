# Projects
Here are some projects that I have worked on either in school, or in my free time.

## [NBA Statistics Data Analysis](./projects/NBAStatsScraping.md)

#### [Project Link](./notebooks/NBAStatsScraping.ipynb)
---
In this project, I wanted to get accurate NBA player statistics through the years, and be able to analyze various statistics. In this first part, I am scraping the data from [nba.com](https://www.nba.com) from the years 2014-2023 for all players in the regular season, and the playoffs. I will go through my notebook, and explain what each individual cell does.
