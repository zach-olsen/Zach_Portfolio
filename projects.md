# Projects
Here are some projects that I have worked on either in school, or in my free time.

### [NBA Statistics Data Analysis](./projects/NBAStatsScraping.md)
In this project, I wanted to get accurate NBA player statistics through the years, and be able to analyze various statistics. In this first part, I am scraping the data from [nba.com](https://www.nba.com) from the years 2014-2023 for all players in the regular season and the playoffs. In the second part of the project, I go to analyze the data and look at various stats. 

The first two parts of this project are gotten directly from a YouTube video by Alex Sington. The videos can be found at the following links:
