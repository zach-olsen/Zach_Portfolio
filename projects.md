# Projects
Here are some projects that I have worked on either in school, or in my free time.

## NBA Statistic Data Analysis

The first two parts of this project are gotten directly from a YouTube video by Alex Sington. The videos can be found at the following links:

[Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aprt035um3o)

### [NBA Statistics Data Scraping](NBAStatsScraping.md)
In this project, I wanted to get accurate NBA player statistics through the years, and be able to analyze various statistics. In this first part, I am scraping the data from [nba.com](https://www.nba.com) from the years 2014-2023 for all players in the regular season and the playoffs. In the second part of the project, I go to analyze the data and look at various stats.

### [NBA Statistics Data Analysis](NBADataAnalysis.md)
In the second part of this project, I take the data scraped from part 1 and analyze said data. How are stats correlated? How are minutes distributed? How has the game changed over the past 10 years? What's the difference between regular season and playoffs? All these questions will be answered in this project.

## [AI Ethics Paper](paper.md)
This was a final paper I had to write for my Artifical Intelligence class at Ursinus College. I wrote my paper about restricting generative-AI music.
